This repository was created to support the application to the MSCA 2025. 

Here, I will collate datasets regarding biodiversity and heterogeneity for each one of the proposed projects.

Each folder leads to the data and methods proposed to use in each Work Package (WP). 

Below, a description of the files present in each folder:


Biodiversity data:
-

MPA data:
- 

Satellite data:
- 100 m resolution, open access, European Seas: https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/5194057-introduction-to-ocean-colour-sentinel-2-high-resolution-products
- 

Bathymetry data:
-

Field data:
- 

Create an R markdown explaining how will I analyse that data.
