## 🔍 Preliminary Search Results

This repository currently hosts the **preliminary stage** of the HARNESS-MPA systematic review.  
At this point, we share the **search strategy** and the **first batch of results** retrieved from scientific databases.

### 📑 Search Strategy
The full set of Boolean search strings used in each database is documented here:  
👉 [`search/search_terms.md`](search/search_terms.md)

This ensures full **transparency** and allows replication of the search process.

### 📊 Search Outputs
- **Total records retrieved:** 329 
- **After de-duplication:** 329 

A detailed breakdown of the number of records in Web of Science can be found here:  
👉 [`results_prelim/counts_by_database.csv`](results_prelim/counts_by_database.csv)

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Continue **title & abstract screening** in Covidence.  
- Finalise **inclusion/exclusion criteria**.  
- Upload a **preliminary PRISMA diagram** and list of included studies.
