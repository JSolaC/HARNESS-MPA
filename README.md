# HARNESS-MPA â€” *Systematic Review of Coralligenous Reef Resilience to Marine Heatwaves*

This repository provides the preliminary outputs of the project **HARNESS-MPA**, which applies a systematic review approach to assess the resilience of Mediterranean coralligenous reefs to marine heatwaves (MHWs) and other extreme climate events (ECEs).

The project is currently at the preliminary search stage, and this repository documents the search strategy and initial results exported from Covidence. Future updates will include full screening outcomes, extraction tables, and reproducible workflows for generating PRISMA diagrams and summary figures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into the following main folders:

- **`search/`**  
  Contains the exact Boolean search strings and a log of all search runs (database, date, notes).

- **`results_prelim/`**  
  Stores outputs from the preliminary search, including counts of retrieved records per database, summary notes, and placeholders for PRISMA diagrams.

- **`docs/`**  
  Holds draft documentation, including the early version of the systematic review protocol and methodological notes.

- **`scripts/`**  
  Reserved for future R/Python code to process Covidence exports, create PRISMA diagrams, and generate figures.

## Current Stage

- Searches completed in databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed.  
- **Total records retrieved:** XXX  
- **Records remaining after de-duplication:** YYY  
- Initial screening underway in Covidence.  

## Next Steps

1. Complete title and abstract screening.  
2. Refine inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
3. Upload a preliminary PRISMA flow diagram.  
4. Share a first list of potentially relevant studies.
