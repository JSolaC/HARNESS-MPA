# HARNESS-MPA

This repository provides the preliminary outputs of the project **HARNESS-MPA**, which applies a systematic review approach to assess the resilience of shallow marine ecosystems to environmental impacts and extreme climate events (ECEs).

The project is currently at the preliminary search stage, and this repository documents the search strategy and initial results exported from Covidence. Future updates will include full screening outcomes, extraction tables, and reproducible workflows for generating PRISMA diagrams and summary figures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into the following main folders:

- **`search/`**  
  Contains the exact Boolean search strings and a log of all search runs (database, date, notes).

- **`results_prelim/`**  
  Stores outputs from the preliminary search, including counts of retrieved records per database, summary notes, and placeholders for PRISMA diagrams.

## Current Stage

- Searches completed in  Web of Science.  
- **Total records retrieved:** 329  
- **Records remaining after de-duplication:** 329  
- Initial screening will be done in Covidence once the project starts.  

## Next Steps

1. Complete title and abstract screening.  
2. Refine inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
3. Upload a preliminary PRISMA flow diagram.  
4. Share a first list of potentially relevant studies.
